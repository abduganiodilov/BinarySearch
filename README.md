#🔍 Binary Search

A simple and efficient Binary Search implementation in Python that finds the position of a given number in a sorted list.
📌 Features

✔️ Finds the position of a target number in a sorted list
✔️ Efficient O(log n) time complexity
✔️ Handles edge cases, such as numbers not in the list

##📖 How It Works

Binary Search works by repeatedly dividing the sorted list in half and checking if the middle element is the target. If not, it eliminates half of the search space and continues the process.

##🚀 Usage

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BinarySearch.git
Run the Python script:
python binary_search.py
Enter the number to search, and it will return its position in the list.

##📝 Notes

The input list must be sorted for Binary Search to work correctly.
If the number is not in the list, the function returns -1.
